# Introduction to Data Science (LTAT.02.002)
# Project: House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques
## Group A11: Hendrik Šuvalov, Raul Tölp

### Description:

<li>Kaggle competition: https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/rules

<li>Ask a home buyer to describe their dream house, and they probably won't begin with the height of the basement ceiling or the proximity to an east-west railroad. But this playground competition's dataset proves that much more influences price negotiations than the number of bedrooms or a white-picket fence. With 79 explanatory variables describing (almost) every aspect of residential homes in Ames, Iowa, this competition challenges you to predict the final price of each home.

### Goals:
<li>what influences the house price
<li>predict final price with Linear Regression or Random Forest model
